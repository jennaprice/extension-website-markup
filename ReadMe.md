# Website Mark Up Chrome Extension

## Overview

The purpose of the project would be to give feedback for a site, directly marking and making comments. 

## Requirements

User would be able to pick a site, hit "record" and start making comments and marks on the page. As long as the stayed in the domain the could markup and make comments on different pages. 

As they make a mark it would save (maybe keep a history until they export), at any point they could make an export and save it as some type of file (maybe json with the pictures/ picture links, and then fields for comments and locations).

The user would be able to export at anytime, we would have to think about if they close the browser and they have made changes we would save it locally.

There would need to be an import function and the ability to load up the pictures and the comments in place.

When they choose clear or stop they would have the option for the page to go back as it was.

User could also use inspection tools to change code and have the picture of that recorded.

As an advanced feature it would note the changes to the code and which file it belonged to.
